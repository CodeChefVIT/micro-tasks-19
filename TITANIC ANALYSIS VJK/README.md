# Exploratory data analytics on titanic dataset using jupyter - J K Vishwajeet

Using Jupyter notebook, we try to analyse the titanic dataset provided by Kaggle. We start off by importing libraries that will help in analysis and exploring the dataset. Next, we look for the important columns that will be needed for analysis. Also,the places where data is not present are omitted. After the cleaning process, We start to analyse the dataset. We try to understand the corelation of the attributes provided with the survival chances of a passenger. We analyse questions such as 'if Sex play a role in Survival','if class played role in survival','corelation between Survival and passengers having Parents and/or Children aboard' and many more. Using the library tools, we observe data and plot histograms and scatterplots to make important hypothesis.
