				<p><h5>CodeChef - A Platform for Aspiring Programmers </h5>
				    CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms, computer programming 		and programming contests. At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the 		start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training 	sessions and discussions related to algorithms, binary search, technicalities like array size and the likes. Apart 				from providing a platform for programming competitions, CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum 				discussions to help those who are new to the world of computer programming.</p>

				<p><h5>Practice Section - A Place to hone your 'Computer Programming Skills' </h5>
				Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our 				programming contest judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were 				never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better 				prepare yourself for the multiple programming challenges that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.</p>

				<p><h5>Compete - Monthly Programming Contests and Cook-offs </h5>
				Here is where you can show off your computer programming skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly coding contest 				and the shorter format Cook-off coding contest. Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our programming 				contests have prizes worth up to INR 20,000 (for Indian Community), $700 (for Global Community) and lots more 				CodeChef goodies up for grabs</p>
